                license which has been valid for the required period of time.
                (The length of the required period of time may vary according to
                the rental supplier. If the rental supplier does not state a
                specific period of time which the license must have been valid
                for, then the default required period of time is one year.) If
                your driver's license is in a different language to the language
                of the country of use, a translated copy of your license that
                meets local requirements must be provided. 3. The credit card
                provided by the main driver must have sufficient payment credit.
                At pick-up, a preauthorization fee will be taken as deposit. 4.
                A valid photo ID (your passport or other internationally
                accepted ID). Important: Ensure you carefully read the terms and
                conditions provided by your rental supplier, and bring any
                additional items or documents required by your rental supplier.

                Yes, you need to pay a deposit at pick-up to protect against
                damage and loss. The deposit is payable when you arrive at the
                branch for pick-up. The deposit amount is decided by the rental
                supplier; please contact your rental supplier directly if you
                have any related queries. The deposit amount will be frozen on
                the main driver's credit card for the duration of the rental
                period. After the rental period is completed, the deposit will
                usually be returned to the same credit card within 28â€“45 working
                days. Actual policies and practices may vary according to the
                rental supplier.

                In most cases, no fee is charged for canceling your booking.
                However, some suppliers may only offer free cancellation within
                a specified time period, and charge to cancel bookings outside
                of that time period. Please ensure you read the booking terms
                and conditions carefully, as rental suppliers may have
                independent cancellation policies.
